    "\n",
    "A Z-test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, particularly when the sample size is large (typically \\( n > 30 \\)) and the population variance is known. It helps assess hypotheses about population parameters when data follows a normal distribution.\n",

    "For a Z-test, the equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = (X bar - mu) / (sigma / root(n))\n",

    "**Uses**:\n",
    "1. **Testing Population Mean**: Used when comparing a sample mean to a known population mean.\n",
    "2. **Comparing Two Means**: To test the difference between two sample means when population variance is known.\n",
    "3. **Large Samples**: Effective for large sample sizes, as it relies on the Central Limit Theorem for normal approximation."
